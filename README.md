## Profiling

The Profiling github contains three main directories: `data_extraction` (where we store all data extraction/preparation scripts), `data` (where we store both the input and the output for this extraction), and `encoder`, where we have the code of our profiling architectures and their output models.

Please refer to the directories `data_extraction` and `encoder` for their individual READMEs, in order to get more information.
